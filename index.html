        <h1>Open Goal</h1>
        <p>A football (soccer) simulation game aiming to provide a bridge between FIFA and Football Manager. Pfft, yeah, like we&#39;re ever gonna do that. (We are.)</p>

<p>Open Goal is a project created by avid FIFA and Football Manager players aiming to blend core gameplay concepts from both into a single game. This repository contains a basic Unreal Engine 4 implementation of some of our ideas.</p>

<p>Our mission is more focused on making well-crafted game mechanics that aren't as "gamified" as, say, FIFA, but without making it a literal simulation of real-life soccer. We consider well-crafted mechanics to be more important than graphics, animations, and timely releases. (Said every unfunded open source project, ever.)</p>

<a id="quick-download" class="anchor" href="#quick-download" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Quick Download</h3>

<p>We don't have a quick download available because the game isn't in a playable state yet.</p>

<a id="the-team" class="anchor" href="#the-team" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Team</h3>

<p>We are two developers, Andriy Katkov and Dennis Lysenko, working on this project alongside school/other projects in our spare time. Both of us have been working on a startup for two years, where we got the original impetus to create this project.</p>

<a id="contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing</h3>

<p>If you have any interest in contributing the quickest way to get in touch is to just open an issue and we'll both get emails about it. Forking independently is not recommended because of how unfortunately annoying merges can be with UE4 asset and blueprint files.</p>

<h3>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h3>

<p>At the moment this isn't even close to stable or playable, but you can install it and try it out by downloading Unreal Engine 4 at <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com">https://www.unrealengine.com</a>. We're not really sure what to do after that, so probably just follow the instructions under <em>Contributing</em> above and get in touch with us so we can help you out with the rest.</p>
